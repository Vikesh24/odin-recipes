    <h1>Hard Candy</h1>
    <a href="../index.html">Home</a>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Hard candy is a type of confectionery that is made by boiling sugar syrup to a high temperature until it reaches
        the hard crack stage. This results in a solid, brittle candy that can be flavored and colored in various ways.
        Hard candies are often enjoyed for their long-lasting sweetness and satisfying crunch.
